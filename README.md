The goal of decrees is to offer a flexible, easy-to-use system for storing and
utilizing project settings. 

The Settings class offers far more flexibility of formats and options versus 
python's configparser package. It is also lighter and easier to extend than many 
of the other packages out there.

The project is also highly documented so that users and developers and make
piles work with their projects. It is designed for Python coders at all 
levels. Beginners should be able to follow the readable code and internal
documentation to understand how it works. More advanced users should find
complex and tricky problems addressed through efficient code.
